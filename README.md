# historymapper
A simple tool to map and visualize correspondence networks. With this tool, students can create a database together in a shared Google spreadsheet, which they can simultaneously visualise. Their spreadsheet is linked to a web page that visualizes the data they have entered into the spreadsheet. Through this application students learn to organise their data in a way computers can work with, they learn how digital tools can help them get new information out of their old sources, and they also are challenged to investigate the limitations of digital methods. The visualisation gives the opportunity to discuss the progress of the students during a class and to check if all the information is entered correctly.
